#!/usr/bin/env bash
# human-queue-notify-hook — the push half of ask-human.sh. Installed by
# `make setup` on the cache backend (the mini) as
# ~/.config/human-queue/notify-hook; ask-human.sh fires it in the background
# right after a request lands on disk, with `<id> <text>`.
#
# One Slack line to #agents, through Argo's Slack proxy — the same door
# audio-gateway announces podcast results through — so the human learns a
# request exists without opening a terminal. The queue itself is the source of
# truth: this is a nudge, and every failure here is soft. It never blocks, never
# retries, never exits non-zero — ask-human.sh has already returned by the time
# this runs, and a hook that could fail an enqueue would be worse than no hook.
#
# The bearer comes from the secrets cache (`secrets-run read`, never `op`: a
# direct `op` call on the mini hangs on a biometric prompt). The channel id is
# resolved from Argo's channel list by name, once per call, so a re-created
# channel keeps working without a config edit.
#
# Usage: human-queue-notify-hook.sh <request-id> <text>

# shellcheck disable=SC2016  # jq filters and Slack backticks are literal by design
