# 1Password SSH agent for NON-INTERACTIVE shells — `ssh iumac -- <cmd>`.
#
# conf.d/secrets.zsh already exports SSH_AUTH_SOCK, but .zshrc is not read by a
# remote command shell, so an agent-driven `ssh iumac 'git pull'` lands with it
# UNSET. Every git remote on the MacBook is `git@github.com:` and the machine
# holds no private key on disk (`ls ~/.ssh/id_*` is empty) — every identity
# comes from 1Password. The failure is therefore not "ssh iumac is down", it is
# `Permission denied (publickey)` one hop further in, which reads like a broken
# tunnel and sends you to the wrong layer. Diagnosed 2026-09-07.
#
# GATED ON THE `op` BACKEND, NOT ON THE SOCKET EXISTING. The socket path exists
# on the MINI too — the desktop app has run there — and exporting it on a
# headless machine is the documented hang: anything that consults that agent
# waits forever on a biometric prompt nobody can answer. That hazard is the
# whole reason `Host iumac` pins `IdentityAgent none` (config/ssh_config), so a
# socket-existence guard here would quietly reintroduce it.
#
# `read` + `<` is a zsh builtin: this file runs for every zsh spawned on the
# machine, so a `cat` would be one fork per shell.
