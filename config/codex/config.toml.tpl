# Codex CLI — the OpenAI lane, on the IU unified endpoint.
#
# RENDERED (not symlinked) into ~/.codex/config.toml by `make setup`: the
# endpoint host is an internal IU URL and never enters git (rules/security.md),
# so `@@IU_OPENAI_V1@@` is substituted from the Keychain `claude-sdk-base-url`
# entry at setup time. Edit THIS file, then re-run `make setup`.
#
# Why Codex exists here at all, when Claude Code is the daily driver: OpenAI's
# reasoning models only carry reasoning items across tool calls over the
# *Responses* API, and Codex is the one harness whose wire protocol is
# Responses-only. Over chat-completions the model re-derives its plan on every
# tool round trip. A Claude-Code-through-an-OpenAI-proxy setup is strictly
# worse than this and is not worth building.
#
# Launch with `cx` / `cxa` (config/zsh/codex.zsh) — they inject the API key.

# Codex's own interactive posture: writes confined to the workspace, and it

# The default is the cheaper 5.6 flagship on purpose. GPT-6 Astra costs several
# times more per token, so it is opt-in via `cxa` (= `--profile astra`).
#
# `--profile NAME` loads $CODEX_HOME/NAME.config.toml — since codex 0.134 it is
# NOT the legacy `[profiles.NAME]` table, which still parses and does nothing.
